# fs-book-organizer

In this lab, you'll build a book organizer using higher order functions in JavaScript.

Build a Book Organizer
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

1.  You should have an array of objects named books where each object in the array should have a string title, another string authorName, and a number releaseYear.
2.  Your books array should have a minimum of three objects.
3.  You should have a callback function named sortByYear that accepts two books as parameter for sorting the array.
4.  The sortByYear function should return -1 if the releaseYear of the first book is smaller than that of the second book.
5.  The sortByYear function should return 1 if the releaseYear of the first book is bigger than that of the second book.
6.  The sortByYear function should return 0 if both releaseYear values are equal.
7.  You should filter out books written after a certain year such as 1950 from the books array and save the filtered array in a new array named filteredBooks.
8.  You should sort the books in the filteredBooks array according to their releaseYear in ascending order. You learned in a prior lecture video that the sort() method will sort the array in place. This means the filteredBooks array will be mutated.
